# SingShout

An implementation of IO monad that instead of writing 
plays its output in Solresol.

## Examples

### Opera

A custom rendition of 'Aria di Mezzo Carattere', 
a part of the opera sequence from Final Fantasy VI 
(a.k.a. Final Fantasy III).

The MIDI file was taken from [fflyrics.com](http://www.fflyrics.com/ff6.html).

### Poem

The program reads a short love poem called 'doremifa'
written in the Latin notation of Solresol.

The poem can be found [here](http://love.poem.free.fr/constructed-poems/solresol-poem.html).
